### Current task
* [ ] Generate libraries and executables
---
* [ ] Make `print <:String>` print without newline
* [ ] Allow generics types usage
* [ ] Check errors in repl too
* [ ] Add more checks for compiler
* [ ] Add constrains to generics
* [ ] Make statements to return `None` type for convenience
* [ ] Make `if to be an expression?
* [ ] Add `Array` type
* [ ] Add `HashMap` type
* [ ] Provide runtime as dylib
* [ ] Multiple errors support instead of exiting on first error
* [ ] Fix memory leak due to pointers to builtin types
